# An annual Workshop proposed by Pierre Mounier

Pierre Mounier is research engineer at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS, Paris) and strongly involved in the development of open scholarly communication platforms as deputy director of [OpenEdition](https://openedition.org), coordinator of [OPERAS](http://operas-eu.org), and co-director of [DOAB](http://doabooks.org).

He is the author of a number of books on digital humanities and open science. His last work entitled Les humanités numériques. Une histoire critique (2018) is available in open access. For further information, see [his website](https://pierremounier.net).

## The complete Digitisation of Information

During the last 20 years has a profound impact on the way knowledge is structured, produced, shared, received, circulated in contemporary societies. This major change in the order of knowledge has been studied from different angles: tools and technology, knowledge management, usages in different contexts, the knowledge economy.

But at the crossroads of these dimensions, the role of the underpinning digital infrastructure to enable or on the contrary to disable, to make visible or invisible, to structure and format certain types of knowledge is still an emerging field of study. Hence our first question:
       
# *How does the digital infrastructure govern knowledge production today?*
       
But if digital infrastructures govern the way knowledge is produced, they are themselves governed in a certain way, and that question is even more rarely considered. Digital infrastructures can be viewed as common places where different types of stakeholders meet; their governance is often crafted under the influence of competing parties (e.g users, engineers, developers, funders and policy-makers) who project their governance models and values on the infrastructures and have to negotiate those models with other stakeholders. Hence our second question:

# *How is the digital knowledge infrastructure governed?*

To address those different questions, the program wil use a multidisciplinary approach, building upon the knowledge made available thanks to research in
       * Anthropology of knowledge, such as the Platform [Savoirs](http://savoirs.app)
       * Library studies and Information Science, such as [CIBER](http://ciber-research.uk/harbingers.html)
       * Political science, such as the recent [*Big Science and Research Infrastructures in Europe*](https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/gbp/big-science-and-research-infrastructures-in-europe-9781839100000.html)
       * History of science and technology, in the context of digital humanities, such as the research developed at [EPFL LHST](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lhst/)
       
  # Stay tuned! and come back regularly on the [homepage of the project](http://https://piotrr70.github.io/GDKI) to discover new developements all along the year.
