# GOVERNING THE DIGITAL KNOWLEDGE INFRASTRUCTURE

The support website to Pierre Mounier's invited scholar program at LHST/DHI/EPFL in 2021-22. #GDKI aims at investigating the governance practices in knowledge digital infrastructures. Through an analysis of different cases, it will try to unfold the governance models at stake in DKIs. The main assumption that will be tested and challenged during the program is that DKIs are at the crossroads of different governance models, coming from academic institutions, physical infranstructures and online communities. How those models interact and conflict with each other in governing digital knowledge infrastructures is a the main question that will be explored during this program.

#GDKI is supported by a monthly seminar and workshop that takes place during the last week of every month during the academic year 2021-22 at EPFL. Here's the list of the past and future sessions (to be updated regularly):
